Here's how to use this optimization script on your TCL 30z:

## Installation & Usage:

1. **Save the script:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/optimize_tcl.sh
   ```
   (Copy the script content, paste it, then Ctrl+X to save)

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/optimize_tcl.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./optimize_tcl.sh
   ```

## Key optimizations for your device:

**Memory Management** - With only 3GB RAM, the script focuses on freeing up memory and optimizing cache usage

**CPU Tuning** - Optimizes the Helio A22 processor scheduling for better responsiveness

**Storage Cleanup** - Important for your limited 32GB storage space

**Battery Life** - Tweaks power management settings to extend your 3000mAh battery

## Additional recommendations:

- **Debloat**: Use `pm disable` commands for unnecessary system apps
- **Custom launcher**: Try Nova Launcher (lightweight) instead of stock
- **Background limits**: Set app background activity limits in Developer Options
- **Animation scales**: Reduce to 0.5x in Developer Options for snappier feel
